# Oi-Override

**Oi-Override** is a lightweight yet powerful CLI tool designed to simplify AI-powered code generation directly within your development workflow. With Oi, you can quickly generate, update, and integrate code using predefined prompts, allowing you to focus on the creative aspects of coding while letting AI handle the heavy lifting.

## Key Features

- **IDE Agnostic**: Oi-Override is designed to work with any IDE, allowing you to seamlessly integrate code generation into your development workflow.
- **AI-Powered Code Generation**: Automatically generate code based on embedded prompts in your files, using OpenAIâ€™s API.
- **Live File Monitoring**: Continuously monitor your project files for updates and code generation prompts.
- **Simple Prompting Syntax**: Use intuitive patterns like `//> <//` to guide AI in generating or completing code snippets in specific locations.

## Quick Installation

Use npm to install oi.. 

```
npm i -g overide
```

Optionally take a look at out [installation guide](https://github.com/oi-overide/oi-overide/blob/main/Installation/Installation.md) for more options.. 

## Usage

Please read the [Detailed Usage Guide](https://github.com/oi-overide/oi-overide/blob/main/Usage/Commands.md) for all the commands and options. 

### Adding API Key

Befor starting run the following command. It will show a list of currently supported platforms and allows to add required information like API KEY, ORG ID
BASE URL and other. 

```bash
oi config --global
```

If you ended up configuring multiple platforms.. i.e ran the above command multiple times and configures details for multiple platforms. You can run the 
following commands to select an active platform. Oi will use the active platform. 

```bash
oi config --select-active
```

### Initialize a Project

To initialize Oi-Override in your project, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
oi init
```

This will create a configuration file and set up Oi to work with your project.

### Start Monitoring

Once Oi is initialized, you can start monitoring the project files for code generation prompts:

```bash
oi start
```

Oi will continuously watch the project directory and respond to any prompts it detects.

### Insert Prompts for Code Generation

Place prompts in your code files to indicate where Oi should generate code. For example:

```javascript
//> Generate a function to add two numbers <//
```

Oi will then generate the required code and insert it directly into the file at the prompt location.

```javascript
  //- Generate a function to add two numbers
  const function = sum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
  //> Accept the changes (y/n): -//
```

Based on the user's response, Oi will either keep the changes or discard them.

## Configuration

Oi-Override uses an \`oi-config.json\` file for customization. You can define the AI service, ignore certain files or directories, and configure other options.

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "project name",
  "ignore": ["node_modules", "*.test.js"],
}
```

## Version 2.0 Plan

- **Project Context Management**: Using local parsers we should be able to generate better prompts that require less tokens.
- **Code Format**: Switch to using unified diff format to improve code insertion.
- **Multiple File Edit**: Oi should be able to edit multiple files at once to execute complex tasks.
- **Script Execution**: Oi should be able to write and execute scripts to automate tasks.
